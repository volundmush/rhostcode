&HLP.HELP #help_files=There are several different help systems available on this game. They also share some syntax rules.%R%RAnything styled like [ansi(hw,<this>)] is a placeholder. You're not supposed to actually type the <>.%R%RAnything found within [ansi(hw,\[these\])] is optional. It can be ommitted. Again, don't actually type the brackets.%R%R[ansi(hw,help)]%R%TThis system is Rhost's built-in helpfiles. Much of it covers the scripting language that RhostMUSH provides.

&HLP.CONNECTIONTROUBLE #help_files=Every now and then, someone who joins the game has problems staying connected. The following advice covers the symptom: you type nothing for a minute or two, and the game stops sending you text-- when you type something, it suddenly says you're disconnected.%r%rThis typically occurs for those behind NAT (Network Address Translation)... in other words, routers and large networks.%r%rTo solve this:%r%r[ansi(h,@toggle me=KEEPALIVE)]%rThis will tell the game to work harder to keep the connection to your character open. There is also the option of setting a timer in your client (check your client's Help files for instructions on doing so) that sends [ansi(hw,IDLE)] to the game every minute or two.%r%rThis will only solve problems related to a lack of activity causing the hardware to invisibly disconnect you. There are some problems it cannot solve.%R%RTo PROPERLY leave the game. type [ansi(hw,QUIT)]%R%RIf you are having issues with ghost/lingering connections, check out [ansi(hw,help @selfboot)]

&HLP.LOCKS #help_files=Rhost has a fairly deep lock system which is best read about in [ansi(hw,help @lock)] and its related helpfiles.%R%RThis game provides a number of special Eval Locks on the global object parent, available for anyone to use anywhere. These make use of Eval's special rule about passing the key as %%1 to allow the text after a / to serve as arguments.%R%R[ansi(hc,Basic Locks)]%R%R[ansi(hw,LK.TRUE/<bool>)]%R%TA simple boolean. /1 is always true, /0 is always false.%R%R[ansi(hw,LK.GTEBITTYPE/<bittype>)]%R%TLocks against the user's bittype().
